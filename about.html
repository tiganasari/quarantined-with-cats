                Cat</h2>
            <p>
                Bubu is a 2-year-old former street cat found in a rubbish pile in West London as a kitten. She was the
                smallest of the litter, but probably the feistiest, bravest, and scrappiest. She's not a people's cat,
                she
                enjoys a quiet household where there are no small children and other animals. She loves her food and
                gets
                particularly excited to wake everyone up around 5am for her breakfast. She loves strings, fresh crispy
                bedsheets, and
                long uninterrupted naps.
            </p>

                Photographer</h2>

            <p>
                Anou is a young designer living in London. She loves taking photographs, especially of the everyday
                mundane
                and activities. She cycles around London, and is a trained ballet dancer
                with an apetite for experimental dancing and afrobeat. She is currently studying at Central Saint
                Martins in
                London.

                Human</h2>
            <p>Despite having a severe cat allergy, the human fell in love with this particular cat immediately (how
                could
                you not). They share
                a deep love of food, naps, and never leaving the house.
